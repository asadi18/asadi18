## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate technologist driven by a curiosity for intelligent systems and a love for clean, scalable code.  
With strong roots in both AI/ML and full-stack web development, I create end-to-end solutions that *think*, *learn*, and *adapt*.

From training neural networks and deploying ML APIs to building full-stack dashboards and dynamic user interfaces, I thrive at the intersection of modern development.
